# Agent Ops: Managing the Unpredictable

Agent Ops is a new operational philosophy for managing stochastic, non-deterministic AI systems.

- **An Evolution of DevOps/MLOps:** Tailored for the unique challenges of building, deploying, and governing AI agents.
- **New Testing Paradigm:** Traditional software tests assert `output == expected`. For agents, this is insufficient.
- **Focus on Quality:** Because language is complex and responses are probabilistic, evaluation must shift from simple pass/fail to assessing overall "quality" against a rubric, often using another LM as a judge.
