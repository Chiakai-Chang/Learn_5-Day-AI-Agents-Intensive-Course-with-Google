# Multi-Agent Systems and Design Patterns

For complex tasks, a "team of specialists" is more effective than a single super-agent.

- **Coordinator Pattern:** A "manager" agent segments a task and routes sub-tasks to specialist agents.
- **Sequential Pattern:** An assembly line where the output of one agent is the input for the next.
- **Iterative Refinement Pattern:** A "generator" agent creates content, and a "critic" agent evaluates it against quality standards.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Pattern:** Creates a deliberate pause for human approval before a critical action is taken.
