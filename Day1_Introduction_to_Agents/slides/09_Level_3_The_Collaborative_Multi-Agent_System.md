# Level 3: The Collaborative Multi-Agent System

- **Description:** A paradigm shift from a single "super-agent" to a "team of specialists" working in concert.
- **Key Concept:** Agents treat other agents as tools, delegating tasks based on specialty.
- **Process:** A "Project Manager" agent receives a high-level mission and breaks it down, assigning sub-tasks to specialized agents (e.g., MarketResearchAgent, MarketingAgent, WebDevAgent).
- **Represents:** The frontier of automating entire, complex business workflows.
