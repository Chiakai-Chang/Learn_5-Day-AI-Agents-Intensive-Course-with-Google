# Core Components of an AI Agent

An AI Agent is a system that integrates four essential components to accomplish a goal:

1.  **The Model (The "Brain"):** The core reasoning engine (LM) that processes information and makes decisions.
2.  **Tools (The "Hands"):** Mechanisms that connect the agent to the outside world, allowing it to perform actions and access real-time data.
3.  **The Orchestration Layer (The "Nervous System"):** The governing process that manages the agent's operational loop, including planning, memory, and strategy.
4.  **Deployment (The "Body and Legs"):** The infrastructure that hosts the agent, making it a reliable and accessible service.
