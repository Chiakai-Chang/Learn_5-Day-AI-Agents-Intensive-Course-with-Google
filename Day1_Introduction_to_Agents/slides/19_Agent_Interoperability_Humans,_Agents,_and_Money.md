# Agent Interoperability

Agents must connect with users, other agents, and financial systems to form a complete ecosystem.

- **Agents and Humans:** Interaction via UIs, computer control, and real-time, multimodal "live mode" conversations (e.g., Gemini Live API).
- **Agents and Agents:** The **Agent2Agent (A2A)** protocol provides a universal standard for agents to discover each other (via Agent Cards) and communicate through asynchronous tasks.
- **Agents and Money:** Emerging protocols like **Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)** and **x402** are creating a trust layer for agents to securely transact on behalf of users, enabling a true agentic economy.
