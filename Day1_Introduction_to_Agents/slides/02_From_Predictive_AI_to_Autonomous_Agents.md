# From Predictive AI to Autonomous Agents

- **Paradigm Shift:** Moving from passive AI (content generation, translation) requiring constant human direction to autonomous AI capable of problem-solving and task execution.
- **What is an AI Agent?** A complete application that combines a Language Model's (LM) reasoning with the ability to take actions to achieve goals.
- **Key Capability:** Agents can work independently, determining the necessary steps to reach a goal without step-by-step human guidance.
- **Purpose of this Guide:** To provide a comprehensive foundation for building, deploying, and managing this new generation of intelligent applications.
