# Model: The "Brain" of the AI Agent

- **Selection is Key:** Choosing a model is a critical architectural decision. Success depends on reasoning and tool-use capabilities, not just benchmarks.
- **Optimize for the Task:** Test models against business-specific problems, balancing quality, speed, and cost.
- **A Team of Specialists:** Use a frontier model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) for complex reasoning and a smaller model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Flash) for simpler tasks to optimize performance and cost.
- **Plan for Evolution:** The AI landscape changes rapidly. Implement an "Agent Ops" practice to continuously evaluate and upgrade models without architectural overhauls.
