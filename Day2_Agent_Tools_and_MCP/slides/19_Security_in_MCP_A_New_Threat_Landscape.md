# Security in MCP: A New Threat Landscape

Connecting agents to tools via MCP introduces a new set of security challenges beyond traditional vulnerabilities.

- **MCP as a New API Surface:** Exposing existing systems via MCP can create new vulnerabilities if the server doesn't implement robust security controls like authentication, rate limiting, and observability.

- **MCP as a Standard Protocol:** Its broad applicability across many use cases (including those with sensitive data) increases the likelihood and potential severity of security issues, especially unauthorized actions and data exfiltration.

Securing MCP requires a proactive, multi-layered approach that addresses both new and traditional attack vectors.
