# Introduction: Models, Tools, and Agents

- **The Limitation of Models:** Foundation models, on their own, are pattern prediction engines. They cannot access new data, interact with external systems, or influence their environment.

- **The Role of Tools:** Tools act as the "eyes" and "hands" for an AI model, allowing it to perceive and act on the world. They enable models to go beyond generating content based on training data.

- **The Power of Agents:** Agentic AI uses a model's reasoning to achieve goals by leveraging external tools. This capacity for external action is transforming enterprise applications.

- **The Integration Challenge:** Connecting tools to models presents significant technical and security challenges. The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** was introduced to streamline this integration.
