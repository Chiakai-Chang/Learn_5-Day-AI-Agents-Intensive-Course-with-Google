# MCP Advantage: Accelerating Development & Fostering a Reusable Ecosystem

- ### Simplifies Integration
  By providing a common protocol, MCP dramatically reduces the custom development cost and time-to-market for new AI-driven features.

- ### Fosters a "Plug-and-Play" Ecosystem
  MCP enables tools to become reusable, shareable assets. Developers can discover and contribute pre-built connectors, avoiding redundant work.

- ### Creates Network Effects
  Public registries, like the official **MCP Registry**, provide a central source for discovering public MCP servers. This can accelerate the growth of the entire AI tool ecosystem, making more capabilities available to everyone.
