# The 'N x M' Integration Problem

### The Challenge of a Fragmented Ecosystem

The world of AI tools, data sources, and integrations is complex and fragmented. Integrating an LLM with an external tool typically requires a custom-built, one-off connector for each specific pairing.

### The "N x M" Explosion

This leads to the **"N x M" integration problem**: the development effort grows exponentially as you add more models (N) and more tools (M).

- **N Models x M Tools = N * M Custom Connectors**

This unsustainable scaling issue creates a major bottleneck for AI development, demanding a standardized approach to tool integration.
