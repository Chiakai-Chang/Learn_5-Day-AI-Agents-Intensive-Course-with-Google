# MCP Advantage: Architectural Flexibility & Governance Foundations

- ### Promotes Architectural Flexibility
  By decoupling the agent from the tool's implementation, MCP supports modern, modular system designs like the **"agentic AI mesh."** This makes systems easier to debug, scale, and maintain. Organizations can switch LLM providers or backend services without re-architecting the integration layer.

- ### Provides Foundations for Governance
  While native security is limited, MCP's architecture provides the necessary hooks for robust governance. Security policies and access controls can be embedded within the MCP server, creating a single point of enforcement.

- ### Enables "Human-in-the-Loop"
  The protocol's design encourages obtaining user consent before invoking tools or sharing data, providing a critical safety layer for autonomous systems.
