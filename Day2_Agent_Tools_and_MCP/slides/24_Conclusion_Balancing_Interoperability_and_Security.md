# Conclusion: Balancing Interoperability and Security

- **Tools are Essential:** Tools give models the ability to perceive and act on the world. Their effectiveness depends on good design: clear documentation, granular tasks, and concise outputs.

- **MCP's Promise:** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers a powerful standard to solve the "N x M" integration problem and foster a reusable tool ecosystem.

- **The Enterprise Gap:** However, MCP's decentralized origins mean it lacks native enterprise-grade security, identity management, and observability. This creates a new threat landscape (e.g., Tool Shadowing, Dynamic Capability Injection).

- **The Path Forward:** The future of enterprise MCP is not the "pure" protocol but a version wrapped in layers of centralized governance. Adopters must implement a multi-layered defense using API gateways, hardened SDKs, and secure design practices to bridge the gap between interoperability and security.
