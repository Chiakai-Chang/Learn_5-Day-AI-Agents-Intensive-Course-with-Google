# Introduction to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- **An Open Standard:** Introduced by Anthropic in 2024, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to address the "N x M" integration problem.

- **Goal:** To replace the fragmented landscape of custom integrations with a unified, "plug-and-play" protocol.

- **Universal Interface:** MCP aims to serve as a universal interface between AI applications (agents) and the vast world of external tools and data sources.

- **Decoupling:** By standardizing the communication layer, MCP decouples the AI agent from the specific implementation details of the tools it uses, fostering a more modular, scalable, and efficient ecosystem.
