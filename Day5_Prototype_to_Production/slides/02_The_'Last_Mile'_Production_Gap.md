# Introduction: From Prototype to Production

You can spin up an Al agent prototype in minutes, maybe even seconds. But turning that clever demo into a trusted, production-grade system that your business can depend on? That's where the real work begins. Welcome to the "last mile" production gap, where we consistently observe in practice with customers that roughly $80\%$ of the effort is spent not on the agent's core intelligence, but on the infrastructure, security, and validation needed to make it reliable and safe.

Skipping these final steps could cause several problems. For example:

- A customer service agent is tricked into giving products away for free because you forgot to set up the right guardrails.
- A user discovers they can access a confidential internal database through your agent because authentication was improperly configured.
- An agent generates a large consumption bill over the weekend, but no one knows why because you didn't set up any monitoring.
- A critical agent that worked perfectly yesterday suddenly stops, but your team is scrambling because there was no continuous evaluation in place.

These aren't just technical problems; they are major business failures. And while principles from DevOps and MLOps provide a critical foundation, they aren't enough on their own.
