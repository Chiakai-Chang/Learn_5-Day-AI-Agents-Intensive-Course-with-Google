# Observe: Your Agent's Sensory System

To trust and manage an autonomous agent, you must first understand its process. Observability provides this crucial insight, acting as the sensory system for the subsequent "Act" and "Evolve" phases. A robust observability practice is built on three pillars that work together to provide a complete picture of the agent's behavior:

- **Logs**: The granular, factual diary of what happened, recording every tool call, error, and decision.
- **Traces**: The narrative that connects individual logs, revealing the causal path of why an agent took a certain action.
- **Metrics**: The aggregated report card, summarizing performance, cost, and operational health at scale to show how well the system is performing.

For example, in Google Cloud, this is achieved through the operations suite: a user's request generates a unique ID in Cloud Trace that links the Vertex AI Agent Engine invocation, model calls, and tool executions with visible durations. Detailed logs flow to Cloud Logging, while Cloud Monitoring dashboards alert when latency thresholds are exceeded. The Agent Development Kit (ADK) provides built-in Cloud Trace integration for automatic instrumentation of agent operations.

By implementing these pillars, we move from operating in the dark to having a clear, data-driven view of our agent's behavior, providing the foundation needed to manage it effectively in production.
