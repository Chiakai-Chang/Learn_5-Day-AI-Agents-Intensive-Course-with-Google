# Operations in-Production: The Observe-Act-Evolve Loop

Your agent is live. Now the focus shifts from development to a fundamentally different challenge: keeping the system reliable, cost-effective, and safe as it interacts with thousands of users. A traditional service operates on predictable logic. An agent, in contrast, is an autonomous actor. Its ability to follow unexpected reasoning paths means it can exhibit emergent behaviors and accumulate costs without direct oversight.

Managing this autonomy requires a different operational model. Instead of static monitoring, effective teams adopt a continuous loop: **Observe** the system's behavior in real-time, **Act** to maintain performance and safety, and **Evolve** the agent based on production learnings. This integrated cycle is the core discipline for operating agents successfully in production.
