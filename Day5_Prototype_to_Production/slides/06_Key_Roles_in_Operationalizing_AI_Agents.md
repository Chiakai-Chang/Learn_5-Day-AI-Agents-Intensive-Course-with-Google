# Key Roles in Operationalizing AI Agents

In a traditional MLOps landscape, this involves several key teams:

- **Cloud Platform Team**: Manages foundational cloud infrastructure, security, and access control.
- **Data Engineering Team**: Builds and maintains data pipelines, handling ingestion, preparation, and quality standards.
- **Data Science and MLOps Team**: Data scientists experiment with and train models; ML engineers automate the end-to-end ML pipeline. MLOps Engineers support by building and maintaining standardized pipeline infrastructure.
- **Machine Learning Governance**: Oversees the ML lifecycle, ensuring compliance, transparency, and accountability.

Generative AI introduces new specialized roles:

- **Prompt Engineers**: Blend technical skill in crafting prompts with deep domain expertise.
- **AI Engineers**: Responsible for scaling GenAI solutions to production, building robust backend systems.
- **DevOps/App Developers**: Build front-end components and user-friendly interfaces that integrate with the GenAI backend.

The scale and structure of an organization will influence these roles; in smaller companies, individuals may wear multiple hats, while mature organizations will have more specialized teams. Effectively coordinating all these diverse roles is essential for establishing a robust operational foundation and successfully productionizing both traditional ML and generative AI initiatives.
