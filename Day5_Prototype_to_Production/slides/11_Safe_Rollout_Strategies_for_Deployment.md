# Safe Rollout Strategies for Deployment

While comprehensive pre-production checks are essential, real-world application inevitably reveals unforeseen issues. Rather than switching $100\%$ of users at once, consider minimizing risk through gradual rollouts with careful monitoring.

Here are four proven patterns that help teams build confidence in their deployments:

- **Canary**: Start with $1\%$ of users, monitoring for prompt injections and unexpected tool usage. Scale up gradually or roll back instantly.
- **Blue-Green**: Run two identical production environments. Route traffic to "blue" while deploying to "green," then switch instantly. If issues emerge, switch back—zero downtime, instant recovery.
- **A/B Testing**: Compare agent versions on real business metrics for data-driven decisions. This can happen either with internal or external users.
- **Feature Flags**: Deploy code but control release dynamically, testing new capabilities with select users first.

All these strategies share a foundation: rigorous versioning. Every component—code, prompts, model endpoints, tool schemas, memory structures, even evaluation datasets—must be versioned. When issues arise despite safeguards, this enables instant rollback to a known-good state. See this as your production "undo" button!

You can deploy agents using Agent Engine or Cloud Run, then leverage Cloud Load Balancing for traffic management across versions or connect to other microservices. The Agent Starter Pack provides ready-to-use templates with GitOps workflows—where every deployment is a git commit, every rollback is a git revert, and your repository becomes the single source of truth for both current state and complete deployment history.
