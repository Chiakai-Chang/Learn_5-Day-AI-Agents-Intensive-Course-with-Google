# The Three Pillars: Evaluation, CI/CD, and Observability

To navigate these challenges successfully, you need a foundation built on three key pillars:

1.  **Automated Evaluation**
2.  **Automated Deployment (CI/CD)**
3.  **Comprehensive Observability**

This whitepaper is your step-by-step playbook for building that foundation and navigating the path to production! We'll start with the pre-production essentials, showing you how to set up automated CI/CD pipelines and use rigorous evaluation as a critical quality check. From there, we'll dive into the challenges of running agents in the wild, covering strategies for scaling, performance tuning, and real-time monitoring. Finally, we'll look ahead to the exciting world of multi-agent systems with the Agent-to-Agent protocol and explore what it takes to get them communicating safely and effectively.
