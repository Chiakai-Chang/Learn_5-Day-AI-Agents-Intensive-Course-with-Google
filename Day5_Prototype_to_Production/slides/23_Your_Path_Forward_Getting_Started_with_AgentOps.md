# Your Path Forward: Getting Started with AgentOps

- If you're starting out, focus on the fundamentals: build your first evaluation dataset, implement a CI/CD pipeline, and establish comprehensive monitoring. The Agent Starter Pack is a great place to start—it creates a production-ready agent project in minutes with these foundations already built-in.

- If you're scaling, elevate your practice: automate the feedback loop from production insight to deployed improvement and standardize on interoperable protocols to build a cohesive ecosystem, not just point solutions.

The next frontier is not just building better individual agents, but orchestrating sophisticated multi-agent systems that learn and collaborate. The operational discipline of AgentOps is the foundation that makes this possible.

We hope this playbook empowers you to build the next generation of intelligent, reliable, and trustworthy AI. Bridging the last mile is therefore not the final step in a project, but the first step in creating value!
