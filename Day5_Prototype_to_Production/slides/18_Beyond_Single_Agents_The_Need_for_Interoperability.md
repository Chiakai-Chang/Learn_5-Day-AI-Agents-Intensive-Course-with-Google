# Beyond Single-Agent Operations

You've mastered operating individual agents in production and can ship them at high velocity. But as organizations scale to dozens of specialized agents—each built by different teams with different frameworks—a new challenge emerges: these agents can't collaborate. The next section explores how standardized protocols can transform these isolated agents into an interoperable ecosystem, unlocking exponential value through agent collaboration.

# A2A - Reusability and Standardization

You've built dozens of specialized agents across your organization. The customer service team has their support agent. Analytics built a forecasting system. Risk management created fraud detection. But here's the problem: these agents can't talk to each other - whether that be because they were created in different frameworks, projects or different clouds altogether.

This isolation creates massive inefficiency. Every team rebuilds the same capabilities. Critical insights stay trapped in silos. What you need is interoperability—the ability for any agent to leverage any other agent's capabilities, regardless of who built it or what framework they used.
