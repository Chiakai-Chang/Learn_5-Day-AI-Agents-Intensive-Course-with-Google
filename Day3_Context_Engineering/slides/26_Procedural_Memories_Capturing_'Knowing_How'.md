# Procedural Memories: Capturing 'Knowing How'

Most systems focus on declarative memory ("knowing what"). Procedural memory ("knowing how") is different.

*   **Goal:** Not to retrieve a fact, but to retrieve a **plan** or **playbook** that guides the agent on how to execute a complex task.
*   **It is a reasoning augmentation problem, not an information retrieval problem.**

*   **Specialized Lifecycle:** Requires different algorithms for extraction (distilling a strategy), consolidation (curating workflows), and retrieval (finding a plan).

*   **vs. Fine-Tuning:**
    *   **Fine-tuning:** Slow, offline process that alters model weights.
    *   **Procedural Memory:** Fast, online adaptation via in-context learning.
