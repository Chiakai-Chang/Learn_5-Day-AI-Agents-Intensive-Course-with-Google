# Core Component 2: Memory

**Memory is a snapshot of extracted, meaningful information from a conversation or data source, persisted across sessions.**

*   **Symbiotic Relationship:** Sessions are the primary source for generating memories, and memories help manage session size.
*   **Personalization Engine:** Provides a continuous and personalized experience for the user.
*   **Interoperability Layer:** Memory managers often use framework-agnostic data structures (strings, dicts), allowing agents built on different frameworks to share a knowledge base.
