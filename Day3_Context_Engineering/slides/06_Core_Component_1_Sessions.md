# Core Component 1: Sessions

**A session encapsulates the immediate dialogue history and working memory for a single, continuous conversation.**

*   **Self-Contained:** Each session is a distinct record tied to a specific user.
*   **Purpose:** Allows the agent to maintain context and provide coherent responses within one conversation.
*   **Analogy: The Workbench**
    *   A session is like a workbench for a specific project, covered in all the necessary tools and notes.
    *   It's temporary and task-specific. Once the project is done, you don't store the whole messy desk; you file away the important parts (which becomes **Memory**).
