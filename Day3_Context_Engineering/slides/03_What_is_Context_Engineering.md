# What is Context Engineering?

**Context Engineering is the dynamic assembly and management of information for an LLM.**

*   **Evolution of Prompt Engineering:** It goes beyond crafting static system instructions to address the entire payload, dynamically constructing a state-aware prompt.

*   **The Goal:** Ensure the model has no more and no less than the most relevant information to complete its task.

*   **Analogy: *Mise en Place***
    *   A chef gathers and prepares all ingredients *before* cooking.
    *   Context Engineering ensures the agent has the right, high-quality information, tools, and instructions to reliably produce an excellent, customized result.
