# Handling Multimodal Memory

It's crucial to distinguish between the memory's source and its content.

1.  **Memory from a Multimodal Source (Common):**
    *   The agent processes non-textual data (images, audio) but creates a **textual insight**.
    *   *Example: Transcribing a voice memo to create a text memory: "User expressed frustration about a shipping delay."*

2.  **Memory with Multimodal Content (Advanced):**
    *   The memory itself contains the non-textual media.
    *   *Example: A user uploads a logo design and says, "Remember this." The agent stores the image file directly in the memory.*

Most systems today focus on the first approach.
