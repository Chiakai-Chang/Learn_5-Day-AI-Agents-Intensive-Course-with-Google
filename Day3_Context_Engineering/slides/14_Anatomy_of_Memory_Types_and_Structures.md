# Anatomy of Memory: Types & Structures

A memory is an atomic piece of context with two parts:
*   **Content:** The substance of the memory (structured JSON or unstructured text).
*   **Metadata:** Context about the memory (ID, owner, labels).

Memories can be classified by the type of knowledge they represent:

*   **Declarative Memory ("Knowing What"):**
    *   Knowledge of facts, figures, and events.
    *   *Example: "The user's favorite team is the Warriors."*

*   **Procedural Memory ("Knowing How"):**
    *   Knowledge of skills and workflows.
    *   *Example: A memory of the correct sequence of tool calls to book a flight.*
