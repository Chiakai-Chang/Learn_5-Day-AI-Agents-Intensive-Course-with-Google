# Memory Organization & Storage

**Organization Patterns:**
*   **Collections:** Organizes content into multiple self-contained, natural language memories for a user.
*   **Structured User Profile:** A set of core facts, like a continuously updated contact card.
*   **"Rolling" Summary:** A single, evolving natural-language summary of the entire user-agent relationship.

**Storage Architectures:**
*   **Vector Databases:** Most common; enables retrieval based on semantic similarity.
*   **Knowledge Graphs:** Stores memories as a network of entities and relationships.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** Combines both for relational and semantic search.
