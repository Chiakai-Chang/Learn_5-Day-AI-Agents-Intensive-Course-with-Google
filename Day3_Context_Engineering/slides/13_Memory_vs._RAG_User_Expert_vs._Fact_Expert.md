# Memory vs. RAG

**RAG makes an agent an expert on facts. Memory makes it an expert on the user.**

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | Inject external, factual knowledge | Create a personalized, stateful experience |
| **Data Source** | Static documents (PDFs, wikis) | Dynamic user-agent dialogue |
| **Isolation** | Shared, global resource | Highly isolated per-user |
| **Write Pattern** | Offline batch processing | Real-time, event-based processing |

**Analogy:**
*   **RAG is the Research Librarian:** An expert on the world's facts.
*   **Memory is the Personal Assistant:** An expert on the user themselves.
