# 09: Observability: From Monitoring to True Understanding

AI agents don't just follow instructions; they make decisions. This demands a shift from traditional monitoring to deep observability.

## The Kitchen Analogy

*   **Traditional Software (Line Cook):** Follows a rigid, deterministic recipe. **Monitoring** is a checklist to verify a known process.

*   **AI Agent (Gourmet Chef):** Creates a novel solution to a goal ("Create a dessert") from a mystery box of ingredients. **Observability** is like a food critic understanding the *entire process*—the 'why' behind the choices—to judge the quality of the work.

## The Critical Question Changes

*   **From:** "Is the agent running?"
*   **To:** "Is the agent thinking effectively?"
