# 03: A Framework: The Four Pillars of Agent Quality

To evaluate agents, we must shift from asking "Did we build the product right?" to **"Did we build the right product?"** This requires a holistic, user-centric framework.

## The Four Pillars

1.  **Effectiveness (Goal Achievement):**
    *   Did the agent successfully and accurately achieve the user's actual intent?
    *   The ultimate measure of task success, tied to business KPIs.

2.  **Efficiency (Operational Cost):**
    *   Did the agent solve the problem well?
    *   Measured in resources: tokens (cost), time (latency), and steps (complexity).

3.  **Robustness (Reliability):**
    *   How does the agent handle adversity and real-world messiness (e.g., API timeouts, ambiguous prompts)?
    *   A robust agent fails gracefully, retries, and clarifies.

4.  **Safety & Alignment (Trustworthiness):**
    *   Does the agent operate within its defined ethical boundaries?
    *   The non-negotiable gate, encompassing fairness, bias, and security.
