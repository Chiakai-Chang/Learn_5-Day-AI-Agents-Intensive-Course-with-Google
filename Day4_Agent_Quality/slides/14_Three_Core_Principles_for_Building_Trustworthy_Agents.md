# 14: Three Core Principles for Building Trustworthy Agents

These principles represent the foundational mindset for building reliable autonomous systems.

## Principle 1: Treat Evaluation as an Architectural Pillar, Not a Final Step.
*   Reliable agents are "evaluable-by-design." Quality is an architectural choice, not a final QA phase.

## Principle 2: The Trajectory is the Truth.
*   The true measure of an agent's logic, safety, and efficiency lies in its end-to-end "thought process." You must analyze the entire path.

## Principle 3: The Human is the Arbiter.
*   Automation provides scale; humanity provides the source of truth. The definition of "good" must be anchored to human values and judgment.
