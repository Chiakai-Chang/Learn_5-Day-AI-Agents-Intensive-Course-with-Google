# 07: The Human Arbiter: HITL and User Feedback

Automation provides scale, but human judgment remains the crucial arbiter of quality.

## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Evaluation

*   **Purpose:** To capture critical qualitative signals, nuanced judgments, and complex domain knowledge that automated systems miss.
*   **Key Functions:**
    *   **Domain Expertise:** Evaluate factual correctness and industry standards.
    *   **Interpreting Nuance:** Judge subtle qualities like tone, creativity, and ethical alignment.
    *   **Creating the "Golden Set":** Establish the gold-standard benchmark for automated systems.

## User Feedback & Reviewer UI

*   **Purpose:** Capture real-world signals of usefulness, clarity, and trust directly from users.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **Low-friction feedback:** Thumbs up/down, quick sliders.
    *   **Context-rich review:** Pair feedback with the full conversation and reasoning trace.
    *   **Actionable UI:** Use dashboards and review queues to make feedback visible and actionable.
