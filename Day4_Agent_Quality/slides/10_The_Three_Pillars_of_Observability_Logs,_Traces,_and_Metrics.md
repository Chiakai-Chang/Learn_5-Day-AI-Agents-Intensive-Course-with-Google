# 10: The Three Pillars of Observability

Observability provides access to the agent's "thought process" by analyzing the evidence it leaves behind. It stands on three foundational pillars.

## 1. Logs (The Agent's Diary)
*   **What:** Timestamped, immutable facts about discrete events.
*   **Tells Us:** *What* happened at a specific moment.

## 2. Traces (The Narrative Thread)
*   **What:** A narrative connecting individual logs (spans) into a coherent story for a single task.
*   **Tells Us:** *Why* it happened by showing the causal relationship between events.

## 3. Metrics (The Health Report)
*   **What:** Quantitative, aggregated health scores derived from logs and traces.
*   **Tells Us:** *How well* the performance went, on average, over time.
