# 02: The Paradigm Shift: From Predictable Code to Unpredictable Agents

## The Evolution of Evaluative Complexity

1.  **Traditional Machine Learning:** Evaluation relied on clear statistical metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
2.  **Passive LLMs:** Evaluation became more complex, relying on human raters and benchmarking for generative, probabilistic outputs.
3.  **LLM+RAG:** The evaluation surface expanded to include the performance of the retrieval system.
4.  **The Active AI Agent:** A profound architectural shift. The LLM is now a reasoning "brain" in a system with new capabilities that break old evaluation models:
    *   **Planning & Multi-Step Reasoning:** Compounding non-determinism at every step.
    *   **Tool Use & Function Calling:** Dynamic interaction with an uncontrollable external world.
    *   **Memory:** Evolving behavior based on past interactions.
5.  **Multi-Agent Systems:** The ultimate complexity, evaluating emergent system-level phenomena.
