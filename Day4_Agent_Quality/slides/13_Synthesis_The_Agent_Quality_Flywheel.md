# 13: Synthesis: The Agent Quality Flywheel

A great agent doesn't just perform; it improves. The Agent Quality Flywheel is a self-reinforcing system for driving continuous improvement.

## How It Works:

1.  **Define Quality (The Target):**
    *   The Four Pillars (Effectiveness, Efficiency, Robustness, Safety) set the direction.

2.  **Instrument for Visibility (The Foundation):**
    *   Observability (Logs & Traces) generates the rich evidence needed for measurement.

3.  **Evaluate the Process (The Engine):**
    *   A hybrid of AI-driven (LLM-as-a-Judge) and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) evaluation provides the push that spins the wheel.

4.  **Architect the Feedback Loop (The Momentum):**
    *   Every production failure is programmatically converted into a permanent regression test, making the system smarter over time.
