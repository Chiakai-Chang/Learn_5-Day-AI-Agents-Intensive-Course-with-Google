# 01: Introduction: The Agent Quality Challenge

## The Dawn of the Agentic Era
We are shifting from predictable, instruction-based tools to autonomous, goal-oriented AI agents. This profound shift shatters traditional models of quality assurance.

**Agent quality is an architectural pillar, not a final testing phase.**

### Three Core Messages:
1.  **The Trajectory is the Truth:** The true measure of quality lies in the entire decision-making process, not just the final output.
2.  **Observability is the Foundation:** You cannot judge a process you cannot see. This requires a technical foundation of Logging, Tracing, and Metrics.
3.  **Evaluation is a Continuous Loop:** The "Agent Quality Flywheel" turns data into actionable insights through a hybrid of AI-driven and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) evaluation.
