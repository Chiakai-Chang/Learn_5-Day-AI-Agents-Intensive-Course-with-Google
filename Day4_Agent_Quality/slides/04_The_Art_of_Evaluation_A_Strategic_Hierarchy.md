# 04: The Art of Evaluation: A Strategic Hierarchy

Agent evaluation is not testing an output, but **evaluating a process**. This requires a top-down, strategic approach.

## The "Outside-In" Evaluation Hierarchy

This model prioritizes the metric that ultimately matters—**real-world success**—before diving into the technical details of *why* that success occurred.

**Strategic Anchor:** "Did we build the right product?"

This approach represents a necessary shift from focusing on internal compliance to judging the system's external value and alignment with user intent.

It's a two-stage process:
1.  **Start with the Black Box:** Evaluate the end-to-end result.
2.  **Then Open It Up:** Analyze the internal trajectory to understand the 'why'.
