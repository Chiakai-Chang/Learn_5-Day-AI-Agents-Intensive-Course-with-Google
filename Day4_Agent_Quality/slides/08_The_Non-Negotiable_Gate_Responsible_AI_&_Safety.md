# 08: The Non-Negotiable Gate: Responsible AI & Safety

An agent that is 100% effective but causes harm is a total failure. Safety is not a component; it's a mandatory, non-negotiable gate for any production agent.

## Key Practices for Safety Evaluation

1.  **Systematic Red Teaming:**
    *   Actively trying to break the agent with adversarial scenarios.
    *   Includes attempts to generate hate speech, reveal private info, or induce malicious actions.

2.  **Automated Filters & Human Review:**
    *   Implement technical filters to catch policy violations.
    *   Couple automation with human review to catch nuanced forms of bias or toxicity.

3.  **Adherence to Guidelines:**
    *   Explicitly evaluate agent outputs against predefined ethical guidelines and principles.

**Performance metrics tell us if the agent *can* do the job. Safety evaluation tells us if it *should*.**
